        <p>From the very beginning The Bread & Butter Bakery was to focus on what we do best, which is making cakes from scratch using traditional methods of baking with wholesome ingredients. We firmly believe in the principal that a cake has to first taste good while its look is secondary.As we continue on this journey, we thank each and every one of you who has walked through our doors and taken home a handcrafted cake or dessert from our home to yours.
With love and gratitude</p>
